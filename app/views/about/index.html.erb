      Nyx Myth is an innovative literary form which mixes narrative memoirs and poetry
      through a paralleled mythical tale as a way of unfolding of knowledge and growth
      attained through self observation. The new age novel deals exclusively with the
      conditioned ideals involved directly with childhood dreams. Nyx Myth also explores
      overcoming romantic relationships in the current modern day world using concepts of
      change and rebirth for a conclusion that will leave you fluttering with a new
      perspective.</p>
